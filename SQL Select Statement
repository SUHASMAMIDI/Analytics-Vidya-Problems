We are going to learn Oracle SQL of "HR" data base

We are going to use here employees table from HR Data base
Columns name are given below 

EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, PHONE_NUMBER, HIRE_DATE, JOB_ID, SALARY, COMISSION_PCT, MANAGER_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID

# SELECT statment
#Defination: when we want to retirive or extract data from database tables we use select statements


#SQL SELECT statement syntax : select [expression] from table_name;

#Expression Defination : Expression can be a column name, arithmatic expression or a simple string
#Table_Name Defination: Table name is nothing but a name of table where you can retirive a data


Example 1: The following syntax represents selecting or retrieve all columns from the employees table of our data base

select * from employees
Output: Displays all the columns of employees tables
# * represents selecting all columns


Example 2: Now lets see how to retrieve specified data using select statement, you can specify either single column name or more than one column name seperated by commas(,).

select last_name from employees;
output: Last_name
        Abel
        Austin
        .
        .
        .
        .
        
        
Example 3: 
select employee_id, first_name, last_name from employees

Output: employee_id  first_name  last_name
        198          Anil        Kumar


Example 4: we can also perform arithmatic like additin, substraction, multiplication, division
In this examples we will se simple arithmatic, lets add 1000 to our employees salary

select last_name, salary, salary+1000 from employees;
