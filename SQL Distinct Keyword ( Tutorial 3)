In neumerous situations we reuired to fetch only uniue rows and uniue data and by the help of SL distinct keyword we can do this

Here i am going to use job_history table of HR sample schema

Example 1:

output: Job_ID (Heading)
        SA_MAN
        SA_REP
        SA_REP
        SA_MAN
        .
        .
Example 2:  Let us use the Distinct keyword to retrive the unique values   

select disticnt job_id from job_history;
output: Job_ID (Heading)
        SA_MAN
        SA_REP
        .
        .
        .
        .
        .
